# dni_visual_clock
A D'ni-style Analog Clock

This was a small "fan project" I developed in late 2015/early 2016.

It uses Python TkInter (and some arithmetic) to draw an analog clock
using the timekeeping system developed by Cyan Worlds (creators of the
1993 computer game Myst) for the fictional D'ni civilization.

The script ``gui_dni_clock.py`` runs the graphical app. However, it
depends on functions found in the module ``dni_clock.py``. In order to
run the graphical app, both files must be in the working directory.
